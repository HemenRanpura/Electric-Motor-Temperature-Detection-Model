# Electric-Motor-Temperature-Detection-Model
This is educational project to detect heating of motor temperature using various values collected.

This project is locally run on the server so you will need to download dataset from - "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wkirgsn/electric-motor-temperature" and save in same directory as project.
Project directory should be as followed .
Folder-
+Templates
  -index.html
+EMTP.ipynb
+app.py
Now run the app.py file and you'll be rpovided with your local host server link, follow that link and project will be executed.
By adding all values accorind to your motor reading you can predict how much your permanant magne would be heated ab could avoid possible risks of harming motor.
